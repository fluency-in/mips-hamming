# MIPS Assembly: Hamming

Write a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or
copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are
vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect
throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very
rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,
the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated
result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.

The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point
mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.

By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands
taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of
the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the
evolutionary path between the two strands.

This is called the 'Hamming distance'.

It is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the
nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT

The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

# Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. This means
that based on the definition, each language could deal with getting sequences
of equal length differently.

For these problems, we use the popular MIPS simulator [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/). Download the MARS jar archive from the MARS website and place it somewhere easily accessible. Also install the Java SDK if you do not have it already.

To run the tests, assemble and run the test runner file for a given exercise either via the MARS simulator GUI, or on the command line. To run on the command line,
specify first the runner file and then your implementation, like so:

    java -jar /path/to/mars.jar nc runner.mips impl.mips

To run in the GUI, `include` your implementation at the bottom of "runner.mips"
by uncommenting the final line.

The test runner will either complete with a “success” message or terminate on a failing test with a message specifying the input for which that test failed.
